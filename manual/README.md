# How do you encurage someone to move more often, while that person doesn't want to carry a cellhone all the time?

I came to this idea because of my father. He's a musician/composer who recently opend his own studio. This means he's sitting 10 hours a day with almost no break at all. I tried to get him to use an app like [Human](http://human.co/), but he forgets his phone all the time, so that didn't work.

## What will it fix / help you with?
This will help you to move more ofter while you're working, without useing your cellphone, and yes, there are a lot of people who dont want to carry that this around all the time. 

The feedback is given silently, so if you're working in a thing like a studio, it won't mess-up your recording. This means all the feedback is given by three RGB Led's. You can change all the settings via the dashboard, you can also see how you did that day/week.

## What you need
* A URL and hosting (if you don't have this, you can google for a how to)
* An ESP8266 (available at stores like the [Hackerstore](http://www.hackerstore.nl/))
* 3 RGB leds (also avalible at the hackerstore)
* A breadboard
* A button or another pressure sensor
* 11 male-male wires
* 4 resistors (brown | black | black | red | brown) 
* 1 USB cable (to connect the ESP to your computer)
* A texteditor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* A FTP Program like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
* The [Arduino Program](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
